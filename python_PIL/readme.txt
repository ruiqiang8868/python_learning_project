Attention:
	Python library PIL include a function name show() which is used 
to display image, but the oprating system should install a environment 
dependece 'ImageMagicK',so if you want the image could be shown normlly 
on the image browser, you must confrim that ImageMagicK has been 
installed, if not, issue the command 'sudo apt-get install imagemagick'.
